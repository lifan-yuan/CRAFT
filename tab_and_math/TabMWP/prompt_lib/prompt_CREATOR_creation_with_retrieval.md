## Instruction
You are given a question with tabular contents, and you are asked to solve a question by coding with Python.
You can use pandas, numpy, math, etc. or other packages if necessary.
You are given a dataframe about a table. The first row is the name for each column. Each column is seperated by "|" and each row is seperated by "\n".
Pay attention to the format of the table, and what the question asks.
Generate the functions that may be used to solve the problem. Please wrap your codes in ```python ... ``` to make it one whole code block.
If necessary, you may also leverage or mimic the tool functions provided in "Tools That Might Help" to help solve the problem, but you can not use the tools in examples unless they are also included in "Tools That Might Help" of your given question. Pay attention to all details such as signs and order of operation within the tools.
You should review both the docstring and internal implementation of the tool functions to correctly pass parameters, rather than solely relying on the docstring. Make sure never misuse tools in case of unexpected erroneous results.

### Question
A candy dispenser put various numbers of orange candies into bags. How many bags had at least 32 orange candies?
### Solution
```python
import pandas as pd
def count_bags_with_32_orange_candies(df):
    """
    This function takes in a pandas dataframe of orange candies per bag, and returns the number of bags that have at least 32 orange candies.
    Args:
    df (pandas.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame object containing the number of orange candies per bag.
    The dataframe should contain "Stem" and "Leaf" columns.
    Returns:
    int: The number of bags that have at least 32 orange candies.
    """
    # prepare a list to calculate candies in each bag
    candies = []
    # calculate the total number of orange candies in each bag
    for i in range(len(df)):
        stem = df['Stem'][i]
        leaf = df['Leaf'][i]
        for j in range(len(leaf)):
            candies.append(stem * 10 + leaf[j])
    # filter the bags where the total number of orange candies is greater than or equal to 32
    filtered = [candy for candy in candies if candy >= 32]
    # count the number of rows
    num_bags = len(filtered)
    return num_bags
