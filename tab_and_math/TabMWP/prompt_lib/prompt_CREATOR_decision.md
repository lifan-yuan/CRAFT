### Instruction
You are given a question with tabular contents, and the related tools that may help you solve the question.
Now you need to write a piece of python code to call the tool to solve the problem.
You are given a dataframe about a table. The first row is the name for each column. Each column is seperated by "|" and each row is seperated by "\n".
Pay attention to the format of the table, and what the question asks.
In your response, first think step by step about the form of the data that you should initialize, and how to call the tool to solve the problem.
Then in your code, initialize the data in a format that is most convenient for you to solve the question, call the tool to solve the problem, and finally print out you answer.
Pay attention to the type of data in the table, do not mix up strings and list of numbers (List[int]/List[float]).
Please wrap your codes in ```python ... ``` to make it one whole code block.
You should review both the docstring and internal implementation of the tool functions to correctly pass parameters, rather than solely relying on the docstring.
### Table
Name: None
Unit: $
Content:
Date | Description | Received | Expenses | Available Funds
 | Balance: end of July | | | $260.85
8/15 | tote bag | | $6.50 | $254.35
8/16 | farmers market | | $23.40 | $230.95
8/22 | paycheck | $58.65 | | $289.60
### Question
This is Akira's complete financial record for August. How much money did Akira receive on August 22?
### Tools
To solve the problem of finding out how much money Akira received on August 22, we need to look at the "Received" column in the row where the "Description" column contains the word "paycheck". Then we should retrieve the element, which should be the final answer.
```python
import pandas as pd
def find_received_money(df):
    """
    This function takes in a pandas dataframe of financial records, and returns the amount of money received in a given date.
    Args:
    df (pandas.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame object containing financial records.
    The dataframe should contain "Date", "Description", "Received", "Expenses", "Available Funds".
    Returns:
    float: The amount of money received in a given date.
    """
    # get the row where description is paycheck
    paycheck_row = df[df['Description'] == 'paycheck']
    # get the 'Received' value from that row
    received_money = paycheck_row['Received'].iloc[0]
    return received_money
```
### Solution Code
The tool takes in a pandas dataframe, so we need to initialize the table into a dataframe with appropriate keys. Note that some elements are empty, so we need to fill them with empty strings. Then we call the tool to solve the problem, and print out the answer.
```python
# Initialize the table into a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Date': [' ', '8/15', '8/16', '8/22'],
    'Description': ['Balance: end of July', 'tote bag', 'farmers market', 'paycheck'],
    'Received': ['', '', '', 58.65],
    'Expenses': ['', 6.50, 23.40, ''],
    'Available Funds': [260.85, 254.35, 230.95, 289.60]
})
# Call the tool to solve the problem
find_received_money(df)
```

### Table

Unit: bags
Content:
Stem | Leaf 
2 | 2, 3, 9

5 | 0, 6, 7, 9
6 | 0
7 | 1, 3, 9
8 | 5
### Question
A candy dispenser put various numbers of orange candies into bags. How many bags had at least 32 orange candies?
### Tools
Stem and leaf is a way to organize data. Stem represents the first digit (tenth digit) of the data, and leaf represents the last digit (unit digit) of the data.
To solve the problem of finding the number of bags that had at least 32 orange candies, we need to first calculate the total number of orange candies in each bag by multiplying the stem value by 10 and adding the digits in the leaf. Then, we can filter the rows where the total number of orange candies is greater than or equal to 32 and count the number of rows.
```python
import pandas as pd
def count_bags_with_32_orange_candies(df):
    """
    This function takes in a pandas dataframe of orange candies per bag, and returns the number of bags that have at least 32 orange candies.
    Args:
    df (pandas.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame object containing the number of orange candies per bag.
    The dataframe should contain "Stem" and "Leaf" columns.
    Returns:
    int: The number of bags that have at least 32 orange candies.
    """
    # prepare a list to calculate candies in each bag
    candies = []
    # calculate the total number of orange candies in each bag
    for i in range(len(df)):
        stem = df['Stem'][i]
        leaf = df['Leaf'][i]
        for j in range(len(leaf)):
            candies.append(stem * 10 + leaf[j])
    # filter the bags where the total number of orange candies is greater than or equal to 32
    filtered = [candy for candy in candies if candy >= 32]
    # count the number of rows
    num_bags = len(filtered)
    return num_bags
```
### Solution Code
We should first create a pandas dataframe with the data from the table. Note that some elements are empty, so we need to fill them with empty lists. Then we call the tool to solve the problem, and print out the answer.
```python
# Initialize the table into a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Stem': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    'Leaf': [[2, 3, 9], [], [], [0, 6, 7, 9], [0], [1, 3, 9], [5]]
})
# Call the tool to solve the problem
count_bags_with_32_orange_candies(df)
```
