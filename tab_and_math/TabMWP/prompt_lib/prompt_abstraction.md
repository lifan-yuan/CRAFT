**Rewriting Code to Create a Generic Tool Function**

**Purpose:** Given a query and its corresponding code solution, your task is to rewrite and abstract the code to create a general tool function that can be applied to similar queries. The tool function should solve a higher-level question that encompasses the original query and extend the code's functionality to make it more versatile and widely applicable.

Consider the following principles:

1. The generic tool function should solve queries of the same type, based on common reasoning steps without mentioning specific object names or entity terms.
2. Name the function and write the docstring concerning both the core reasoning pattern and data organization format, without referencing specific objects.
3. Replace specific strings or variable names with general variables to enhance the tool's applicability to various queries. All columns names used inside the tool should be passed in as arguments.
4. Call the tool function to solve the original query. End your answer with the format '# The final generic tool with docstring is: ...' and '# The example to call the tool is: ...'.

    # prepare a list to calculate candies in each bag

Abstrcted tool function:
We're creating a generic tool function from specific code that counts the number of bags with at least a certain threshold of candies based on a stem-and-leaf plot. The original code combines the stem and leaf values to calculate the total number of candies in each bag, filters the bags with candies greater than or equal to the threshold value, and counts the number of such bags. We generalize the problem to create a flexible function for any stem-and-leaf plot of items and various threshold values. We replace specific columns, item names, and threshold values with generic variables like stem_col, leaf_col, item_threshold, and data_frame.
```python
# The final generic tool with docstring is:
def count_groups_above_threshold_in_stem_leaf(data_frame, stem_col, leaf_col, item_threshold):
    """

    stem_col (str): The column name for the stem values.
    leaf_col (str): The column name for the leaf values.
    item_threshold (int): The threshold value for filtering items.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of items with values greater than or equal to the threshold.

    # Initialize the list to calculate items in each group
    items = []
    
    # Calculate the total value of items in each group
    for i in range(len(data_frame)):
        stem = data_frame[stem_col][i]
        leaf = data_frame[leaf_col][i]
        for j in range(len(leaf)):
            items.append(stem * 10 + leaf[j])
    
    # Filter the items where the total value is greater than or equal to the threshold
    filtered = [item for item in items if item >= item_threshold]
    
    # Count the number of items
    num_items = len(filtered)

Abstrcted tool function:
We're creating a generic tool function from specific code that calculates the total cost of items based on a table of item prices per unit and a dictionary of item quantities. We identify the core reasoning of the specific code is to calculate the total cost based on item prices and quantities for each item, i.e. total_cost = unit_price * item_quantity. The original code iterates through item names, filters the table for each item, and calculates the cost based on quantities. We generalize the problem to create a flexible function for any table of item prices and a dictionary of quantities. We replace specific columns and item names with generic variables like item_col, price_col, and item_quantities. We refactor the code with these variables, creating the new function calculate_total_cost_from_unit_prices_and_quantities.
