**Rewriting Code to Create a Generic Tool Function**

**Purpose:** Given a table, query and its corresponding code solution, your task is to rewrite and abstract the code to create a general tool function that can be applied to similar queries. The tool function should solve a higher-level question that encompasses the original query and extend the code's functionality to make it more versatile and widely applicable.

Consider the following principles:

1. The generic tool function should solve queries of the same type, based on common reasoning steps without mentioning specific object names or entity terms.
2. Name the function and write the docstring concerning both the core reasoning pattern and data organization format, without referencing specific objects.
3. Replace specific strings or variable names with general variables to enhance the tool's applicability to various queries. All columns names used inside the tool should be passed in as arguments.
4. Call the tool function to solve the original query. End your answer with the format '# The final generic tool with docstring is: ...' and '# The example to call the tool is: ...'.

**Example**
Let \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n3x^2 + 2&\\text{if } x\\le 3, \\\\\nax - 1 &\\text{if } x>3.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]Find $a$ if the graph of $y=f(x)$ is continuous (which means the graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).
Specific code solution: 
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_a():
    """
    Finds the value of 'a' that makes the graph of the given piecewise function continuous.
    
    Returns:
    float: The value of 'a' that makes the graph continuous.
    """
    a, x = symbols('a x')

    # Define the piecewise function pieces
    left_side = 3*x**2 + 2
    right_side = a*x - 1

    # Find the value at the point of continuity (x = 3)
    left_value_at_3 = left_side.subs(x, 3)
    right_value_at_3 = right_side.subs(x, 3)

    # Create an equation to solve for 'a' based on the condition of continuity
    equation = Eq(left_value_at_3, right_value_at_3)

    # Solve the equation and return the value of 'a'
    solution = solve(equation, a)
    
    return solution[0]

find_a()

We're creating a generic tool function from specific code that finds the value of a variable in a piecewise function that ensures continuity. The code calculates the appropriate value of a variable by ensuring that the left and right sides of the piecewise function at the point of continuity are equal. We generalize the problem to create a flexible function for any piecewise function, ensuring continuity at a specified point.
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# The final generic tool with docstring is:
def find_constant_for_continuity(x, constant, func1, func2, continuity_point):
    """
    Find the constant that makes a piecewise function continuous at a given point.

    Parameters:
    x (symbol): The symbol for the independent variable.
    constant (symbol): The symbol for the constant.
    func1 (function): The first piece of the piecewise function.
    func2 (function): The second piece of the piecewise function.
    continuity_point (float): The x-value where the two functions should be continuous.

    Returns:
    float: The constant value that makes the function continuous.
    """

    # Evaluate the functions at the point of continuity
    func1_at_cont_point = func1.subs(x, continuity_point)
    func2_at_cont_point = func2.subs(x, continuity_point)

    # Create an equation to solve for the constant based on the condition of continuity
    equation = Eq(func1_at_cont_point, func2_at_cont_point)

    # Solve the equation and return the value of the constant
    solution = solve(equation, constant)

    return solution[0]

# The example to call the tool is:
x, constant = symbols('x constant')
func1 = 3*x**2 + 2
func2 = constant*x - 1
continuity_point = 3

Abstrcted tool function:
We're creating a generic tool function from specific code that finds the value of an inverse function based on a set of rules for an original function. The original code solves for the inverse function by iterating over a multiplier rule and updating the corresponding values of the original function. We generalize the problem to create a flexible function for any linear combination rule with a common multiplier, a base input-output pair, and a target output value for the inverse function. We replace specific values and multipliers with generic variables like base_input, base_output, target_inverse_output, and common_multiplier.
```python
# The final generic tool with docstring is:
def find_inverse_value_linear(base_input, base_output, target_inverse_output, common_multiplier):
    """
    Find the value of the inverse function based on a linear combination rule for the original function.

    Parameters:
    base_input (float): The input value for the original function, f(x).
    base_output (float): The result of the original function, f(base_input).
    target_inverse_output (float): The output value for which the inverse result needs to be found, f^(-1)(target_inverse_output).
    common_multiplier (float): The common multiplier between the original function's input and output values.

    Returns:
    float: The value of the inverse function, x, such that f^(-1)(target_inverse_output) = x.
    """
    current_input = base_input
    current_output = base_output

    while current_output != target_inverse_output:
        current_input *= common_multiplier
        current_output *= common_multiplier

    return current_input
