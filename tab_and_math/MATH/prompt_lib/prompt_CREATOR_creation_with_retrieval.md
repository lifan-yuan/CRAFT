## Instruction
You are given a math question, and you are asked to design python functions to help solve a question.
You can use math, scipy, numpy, sympy, etc. or other packages if necessary.
You should specify the parameters and returns of your tool and how to use your tool with explanation.
You must write a function wrapped in ```python ``` code blocks. No extra texts are allowed.
If necessary, you may also *leverage* or *mimic* the tool functions provided in "Tools That Might Help" to help solve the problem. Pay attention to all details such as signs and order of operation within the tools.
You should review both the docstring and internal implementation of the tool functions to correctly pass parameters, rather than solely relying on the docstring. Make sure never misuse tools in case of unexpected erroneous results.
