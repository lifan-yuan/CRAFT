### Instruction
You are given a math question, and you are asked to design python tools to help solve a question.
You can use math, scipy, numpy, sympy, etc. or other packages if necessary.
You should specify the parameters and returns of your tool and how to use your tool with explanation.
You could create more than one tool if you think they may all help solve the problem.

### Question
The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?
### Tools
```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def max_rectangle_area(perimeter):
    """
    Calculates the maximum area of a rectangle with a given perimeter.
    """
    # Define the function to be optimized
    def area(x):
        return -x[0] * x[1]  # negative sign to maximize area
    
    # Define the constraint function
    def constraint(x):
        return 2*x[0] + 2*x[1] - perimeter
    
    # Define the initial guess for the variables
    x0 = [0, perimeter/2]

    # Define the bounds for the variables
    bounds = ((0, perimeter/2), (0, perimeter/2))
    
    # Define the constraint dictionary
    constraints = {'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint}
    
    # Use the minimize function from SciPy to solve the optimization problem
    result = minimize(area, x0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
    
    # Return the negative of the minimum value as the maximum area
    return -result.fun
```

### Question
Point $P$ lies on the line $x= -3$ and is 10 units from the point $(5,2)$. Find the product of all possible $y$-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions.
### Tools
```python
def distance_formula(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Calculates the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
    """
    return ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5


def possible_ys(x, dist, center):
    """
    Returns a list of all possible y-coordinates of a point that is a
    distance of `dist` away from `center` and lies on the line x = `x`.
    """
    y_diff = dist**2 - (center[0]-x)**2
    if y_diff < 0:
        return []
    elif y_diff == 0:
        return [center[1]]
    else:
        return [center[1] + y_diff**0.5, center[1] - y_diff**0.5]
```

### Question
If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?
### Tools
```python
from sympy import symbols, solve

def solve_equations():
    """
    Solves the system of equations 3p + 4q = 8 and 4p + 3q = 13 using sympy.
    Returns: The value of q that satisfies both equations.
    """
    p, q = symbols('p q')
    eq1 = 3*p + 4*q - 8
    eq2 = 4*p + 3*q - 13
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (p, q))
    return solution[q]
```

### Question
How many 3-letter words can we make from the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are allowed to repeat letters, and we must use the letter A at least once? (Here, a word is an arbitrary sequence of letters.)
### Tools
```python
def count_words():
    """
    The function count the number of 3-letter words that conform to the given conditions and return the final answer.
    """
    letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
    count = 0
    # loop through all possible combinations of letters and count the ones that meet the criteria
    for i in letters:
        for j in letters:
            for k in letters:
                word = i + j + k
                if 'A' in word:
                    count += 1
    return count
```

### Question
What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?
### Tools
```python
import math

def solve_box_volume(area1, area2, area3):
    """
    Computes the volume of a rectangular box, given the areas of its three faces.
    Args:
    - area1, area2, area3: the areas of the three faces of the box
    Returns:
    - the volume of the box
    """
    # compute the product of the areas of the three faces
    product = area1 * area2 * area3
    # compute the square root of the product
    root = math.sqrt(product)
    # compute the volume of the box
    volume = root
    return volume
```
