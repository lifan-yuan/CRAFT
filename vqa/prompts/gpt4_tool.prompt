class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left, lower, right, upper : int
        An int describing the position of the (left/lower/right/upper) border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

    Methods
    -------
    find(object_name: str)->List[ImagePatch]
        Returns a list of new ImagePatch objects containing crops of the image centered around any objects found in the
        image matching the object_name.
    exists(object_name: str)->bool
        Returns True if the object specified by object_name is found in the image, and False otherwise.
    verify_property(property: str)->bool
        Returns True if the property is met, and False otherwise.
    best_text_match(option_list: List[str], prefix: str)->str
        Returns the string that best matches the image.
    simple_query(question: str=None)->str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer to "What is this?".
    compute_depth()->float
        Returns the median depth of the image crop.
    crop(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int)->ImagePatch
        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing a crop of the image at the given coordinates.
    llm_query(question: str, long_answer: bool)->str
        References a large language model (e.g., GPT) to produce a response to the given question. Default is short-form answers, can be made long-form responses with the long_answer flag.

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
- Use the bing_search function to access external information and llm_query to perform logical reasoning, answering informational questions not concerning the image.
- Never directly return a long string. All strings inside the function should be short and concise, without any specific item.
