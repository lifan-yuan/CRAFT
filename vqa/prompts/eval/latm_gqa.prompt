class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left, lower, right, upper : int
        An int describing the position of the (left/lower/right/upper) border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

    Methods
    -------
    find(object_name: str)->List[ImagePatch]
        Returns a list of new ImagePatch objects containing crops of the image centered around any objects found in the
        image matching the object_name.
    exists(object_name: str)->bool
        Returns True if the object specified by object_name is found in the image, and False otherwise.
    verify_property(property: str)->bool
        Returns True if the property is met, and False otherwise.
    best_text_match(option_list: List[str], prefix: str)->str
        Returns the string that best matches the image.
    simple_query(question: str=None)->str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer to "What is this?".
    compute_depth()->float
        Returns the median depth of the image crop.
    crop(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int)->ImagePatch
        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing a crop of the image at the given coordinates.

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class (above) that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.


**Note: If necessary, you may also leverage the following tools to directly perform complex operations. 
However, please carefully review the implementation code of the tool functions to determine whether to utilize any of them.
Additionally, consider the appropriate method of passing parameters based on your comprehension of the internal implementation of the tool functions, rather than solely relying on the docstring.**
