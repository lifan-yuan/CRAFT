Surfing competitions can be organized in multiple stages or rounds, with surfers advancing through the stages based on their performance or scores. 

In this case, the man holding the surfboard could have emerged as the winner of the third stage in the competition, which would justify the surfboard saying ""Stage 3 Winner."" By holding up the surfboard with that message, he may be celebrating his victory and sharing his achievement with others.

Surfing competitions often involve judging participants on factors such as the difficulty of the maneuvers they perform, the size of the wave they ride, their speed and power, and the overall impression they leave on the judges.
