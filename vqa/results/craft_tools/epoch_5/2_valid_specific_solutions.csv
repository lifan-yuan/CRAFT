The story is set in the American South during the 1960s and tells the tale of a young white girl named Lily Owens, who lives with her abusive father. After the death of her mother, Lily runs away from home with her African American caregiver, Rosaleen, to escape her difficult life and search for answers about her mother.

Their journey leads them to a trio of beekeeping sisters named August, June, and May, who live in a pink house and have knowledge about Lily's mother.
